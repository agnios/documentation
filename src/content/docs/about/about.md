title: About AgniOS
---

AgniOS stands as an autonomously created GNU/Linux distribution designed for versatile applications the user would require. Its primary objective is to deliver a personalized and user-centric computing experience aligned with individual expectations. 

Adhering to a rolling-release model, AgniOS consistently offers the most recent stable releases of essential software and operating system features. The installation process initiates with a minimal base system, allowing users to tailor configurations to their specific needs.

## Principles

### Simplicity
AgniOS characterizes simplicity as the absence of superfluous additions or alterations. It distributes necessary software in its original form, as released by developers, minimizing distribution-specific changes. It avoids patches rejected by upstream, and any downstream patches primarily comprise backported bug fixes, which become obsolete with the project's subsequent release.

### Modernity
AgniOS endeavors to uphold the most recent stable versions of its software, steering clear of systemic package disruptions whenever feasible. Employing a rolling-release mechanism, AgniOS enables a singular installation with ongoing updates.

AgniOS integrates contemporary features for GNU/Linux users, encompassing the **systemd** init system, modern **file systems**, LVM2, software RAID, udev support, and the latest kernels.

### User centrality
While numerous GNU/Linux distributions strive for enhanced user-friendliness, AgniOS has consistently prioritized and will continue to prioritize user-centric principles. The distribution aims to cater to the needs of any user transitioning to it, avoiding a narrow focus on a specific audience. It targets individuals seeking to become proficient GNU/Linux users, accommodating their software needs while introducing them to the Linux environment.
